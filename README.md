# Mil's Kitchen
(Developer: Valentino Braga)

Mil's Kitchen is a small business created by a Brazilian chef with the mission of providing healthy food that tastes like home. The site is the face of Mil's Kitchen online and aims to provide information about meal plans and how to order them. My goal with this project was to create a clean, modern design that evokes the feeling of natural food and home.

# Design

The website is designed as four separate pages to enable the user to easily and precisely locate the information they are looking for. The priorities on the site are the information about the plans and the weekly dishes. For this reason we start with a call to action button followed by plans options, how to order and meet the chef sections, bringing an intuitive user flow. The contact page features a form where the users can select and inquire about the choosen plan.

The concept behind of the business is healthy food, plant-based as much as possible and home cooking. This is reflected in the pastel colour palette, in the smooth layout and the showcasing the chef behind the curtains.

## Wireframes

The initial concept of the design can be seen here and they were made through the Balsamiq wireframing software.

## Typography

Ronoto Mono and Shadows Into Light fonts were chosen from Google Fonts. Fonts were selected to represent clear, easy-to-read and 'warmer' feel they inspire in the user.

![Roboto Mono Font](docs/roboto-font.jpg)

## Colour Palette

Colour is a very important aspect for engaging with the audience, the colour theme is based around the color: #FFF9EA. The other colors were chosen to tone with this and keep to the overall theme of natural colours. The colors choice was made with the help of the ColorSpace and Coolors website.

* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/)
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

The colours were tested on Webaim using their contrast checker. In all combinations of colors, the ratio was higher than 14.00:1 meaning that they are a great fit.

#FFF9EA + #0E150E = ratio 17.65:1.

#CAF0EA + #0E150E = ratio 15.15:1.

#DCE6C1 + #0E150E = ratio 14.24:1.

#FFF9EA + #0E150E = ratio 14.24:1.

## Imagery

Images are located in every pages All pages have the same thematic layout, and the layout should be consistent on all pages, including the home page. Images were downloaded from Pixabay, Pexels and drawed by the illustrator Hefestus Cave (exclusively for this project). The images are styled with curved borders which is modern and gives a softer effect which is more pleasing to the user.

Icons were used for social links and buttons. The icons used on the site were taken from:

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Structure 

To keep the user interface easy and smooth as possible, I choose the sticky nav bar style and a storytelling mode. The theme remains the same throughout all four pages:

- Home Page: Shows the appealing hero image with a call to action to see the plans, followed by the plans options, followed by the how it works section, followed by meet the chef section and then the footer with another small navigation and social media.
- Plans Page: Showcase the week's meals and explain the personalised plan.
- About Page: Allows the users to see ethos of the business.
- Order Page: Gives users a chance to communicate with the company and start placing an order.

# Deployment

The website was deployed through the use of GitHub Pages, a feature built in to GitHub. This can be done by following the steps below.
1. In the desired repository, click on "Settings" from the top menu.
2. From the side menu to your left, select "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section.
3. Make sure the "Source" option is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the desired "Branch" from the drop down below (main branch in most cases, making sure the director is set to /(root)).
5. Select "Save", and after it refreshes the page, you will see a box at the top of the page providing you with the URL of your now published site.

To contribute or check the code yourself, you can fork or clone the repository as well.

## Fork
1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click "Fork" in the upper right corner
3. Select the owner, and set the repository name. A description can be added if desired
4. Choose whether to copy the default branch, or all branches
5. Click "Create Form"

## Clone

1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click the "Code" button at the top of the files section of the page
3. Select your desired method for cloning (HTTPS/SSH/GitHub CLI)
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
6. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of "YOUR-USERNAME": "$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DESIRED-REPOSITORY"
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
