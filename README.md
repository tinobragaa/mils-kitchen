# Mil's Kitchen
(Developer: Valentino Braga)

Mil's Kitchen is a small business created by a Brazilian chef with the mission of providing healthy food that tastes like home. The site is the face of Mil's Kitchen online and aims to provide information about meal plans and how to order them. My goal with this project was to create a clean, modern design that evokes the feeling of natural food and home.

# Design

The website is designed as four separate pages to enable the user to easily and precisely locate the information they are looking for. The priorities on the site are the information about the plans and the weekly dishes. For this reason we start with a call to action button followed by plans options, how to order and meet the chef sections, bringing an intuitive user flow. The contact page features a form where the users can select and inquire about the choosen plan.

The concept behind of the business is healthy food, plant-based as much as possible and home cooking. This is reflected in the pastel colour palette, in the smooth layout and the showcasing the chef behind the curtains.

### Wireframes

The initial concept of the design can be seen here and they were made through the Balsamiq wireframing software.

### Typography

Ronoto Mono and Shadows Into Light fonts were chosen from Google Fonts. Fonts were selected to represent clear, easy-to-read and 'warmer' feel they inspire in the user.

![Roboto Mono Font](docs/features/roboto-font.jpg)

### Colour Palette

Colour is a very important aspect for engaging with the audience, the colour theme is based around the color: #FFF9EA. The other colors were chosen to tone with this and keep to the overall theme of natural colours. The colors choice was made with the help of the ColorSpace and Coolors website.

* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/)
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

The colours were tested on Webaim using their contrast checker. In all combinations of colors, the ratio was higher than 14.00:1 meaning that they are a great fit.

#FFF9EA + #0E150E = ratio 17.65:1.

#CAF0EA + #0E150E = ratio 15.15:1.

#DCE6C1 + #0E150E = ratio 14.24:1.

#FFF9EA + #0E150E = ratio 14.24:1.

![Colour Palette](docs/features/color-pallete.jpg)

### Imagery

Images are located in every pages All pages have the same thematic layout, and the layout should be consistent on all pages, including the home page. Images were downloaded from Pixabay, Pexels and drawed by the illustrator Hefestus Cave (exclusively for this project). The images are styled with curved borders which is modern and gives a softer effect which is more pleasing to the user.

Icons were used for social links and buttons. The icons used on the site were taken from:

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Structure 

To keep the user interface easy and smooth as possible, I choose the sticky nav bar style and a storytelling mode. The theme remains the same throughout all pages:

- Home Page: The webpage layout begins with an attractive hero image that includes a call to action prompting visitors to view the available plans. Following this, visitors are presented with various plan options. After the plans, the next section explains how the service works, followed by a "meet the chef" section. The footer section contains additional small navigation and social media links.
- Plans Page: Showcase the week's meals and explain the personalised plan.
- About Page: Allows the users to see ethos of the business.
- Contact Page: Gives users a chance to communicate with the company and start placing an order.
- Thank You Page: After the form is submitted and thankful message appears to provide the answer with a confirmation.
- 404 Error Page: There's a 404 Error Page that handles in case of broken links.

# Features

The website contains 6 pages (home page, plans page, about page, contact page, thank you page and 404 error page).

# Future Features

A few features that could make the website even better are listed here:

1. Add a fifth section on the home page displaying the weekly food in a carousel. Updates every week;

2. Add a "Products" page where it's possible to sell merchandise, condiments, jars of butter and pieces of bread;

3. Add a customer review section;

4. Add a search bar. As the website grows, it can become harder for users to find what they're looking for;

5. Implement a login system where the user can have a profile and access their orders;

6. Implement a loyalty program that rewards customers for making repeat purchases or referring friends to Mil's Kitchen. This can help increase customer retention and attract new customers.

I ran into a bunch of small bugs while working on the project, but I managed to deal with them by looking up online and getting help from my colleagues. Here are a few tricky ones that I had to write down so I wouldn't forget:

Bug: A white bar appeared on the right side of the screen on responsive tests when under 400px.
<br>
Fix: The width of certain elements were set in non responsive way through a fixed width (px). The width was changed to %.

Bug: The sticky navigation bar wasn't working.
<br>
Fix: Added a container element wrapping all the others.
